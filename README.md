# Deep Learning PyTorch Classification

This repository contains a deep learning classification project implemented in **PyTorch**.  
The code is provided in the Jupyter notebook [`dp_classifcation.ipynb`](dp_classifcation.ipynb).

## üìå Project Description
This project demonstrates how to build and train a deep learning classification model using **PyTorch**.  
It walks through data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy
```
## üìä Results

All results (accuracy, loss plots, and model evaluation) are shown inside the notebook.
Please check dp_classifcation.ipynb
 for details.
